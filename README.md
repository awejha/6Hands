# 6Hands
A new card game.
The game consists of two rounds, and in each round, the player with 12 cards puts two cards against one card of the other player. The points are determined based on the color and value of the cards. If the two cards are of the same color, the average of their values becomes the points. If the cards are different colors, the points are equal to the value of the larger card.

At the end of both rounds, the number of hands won by each player is counted. If there is a tie in the number of hands won, no player receives any score. Otherwise, the player with more hands won is declared the winner of the game.
